### Settings for VoyantServer ###

# These are settings that define default values for VoyantServer. In most cases
# the indicated values can be used (or blank to use a default). You can also 
# override the values in this settings file if you launch VoyantServer from the
# command line by using -Dorg.voyanttools.server.SETTING=VALUE. For instance:
# java -Dorg.voyanttools.server.memory=2048 -jar VoyantServer.jar headless=true

# The port to use for the web server (default is 8888). If a port is already in use,
# this can be changed (8889, etc.). If the server terminated unexpectedly the port
# may continue being used and restarting the machine is one way of resetting things.
port = 8888

# The amount of memory in MB to allocate to the server. The default value here (1024)
# is higher than needed in most cases, but with very large text collections, it may
# need to be even higher (2048, 4096, etc.)
memory = 1024

# The absolute path to an existing parent directory that the server should use for data.
# The server doesn't delete data when it's terminated but by default the data folder
# can be a temporary directory that may disappear after a machine restart.
# Leave this blank to use the default directory. The default directory will be a
# temporary directory determined by your operation system UNLESS there's a folder
# called data in the same directory as this settings file – in that case the data folder
# will be used. If you want this behaviour, just create an empty data folder in this
# directory (after that, you can zip up the parent folder and redistribute VoyantServer
# with existing data – this can be used in conjunction with the uri_path below to open
# up an existing corpus automatically (/?corpus=id where id is replaced by the real
# corpus ID that you've created). If the data directory exists and you want to use it
# leave this value blank.
data_directory =

# The context path (after the host) to use (default is /). 
context_path = /

# The query parameters to use after the path. This is a good way to provide
# load a corpus by default, ex: query_parameters = ?input=http://cbc.ca/news/ or ?corpus=333.333
# (where 333.333 is an existing local corpus).
# It's also possible to build a custom menu for the open menu on the front page. Separate
# the corpus ID and a label by a colon and separate multiple entries by commas, making sure
# to escape characters (like spaces), eg:  ?openMenu=444.444:Corpus+One;555.555:Corpus+Two
query_parameters =

# This allows you to limit traffic to the specific host (domain or IP). By default (127.0.0.1)
# it is set to be restrictive and to only accept local requests (in order to favour privacy).
# VoyantServer is also a convenient way to host an instance of Voyant Tools that you might
# want to have more widely accessible, in which case you should comment out this line or remove
# the value.
# host = 127.0.0.1

# By default VoyantServer will direct output to the console window within the VoyantServer
# application (this is a useful place to see what's happening, especially when things go
# wrong); when in headless mode, logs are simply directed to the standard output. This
# setting allows you to direct VoyantServer logs to a file instead, which is especially
# useful when you want to leave a server running and detached from the console
# value should be true or anything else for false (including blank).
logs_file =

# This option defines which corpora appear in the drop-down menu when the user opens an
# existing corpus. If this is commented out or blank then the default value is used
# (currently the Austen and Shakespeare corpora). Corpora are defined using a special
# syntax: corpusID:label and multiple corpora are separated by semi-colon. For instance,
# this would be the default:
# open_menu = shakespeare:Shakespeare's Plays;austen:Austen's Novels
open_menu =

# This allows you to prevent Voyant from accepting any further input, in other words no new
# documents can be added. That doesn't necessarily mean no new corpora can be created, there
# may be a new corpus based on a subset of an existing corpus. The default value is true
# (to allow new input), set this to false to prevent new input from being added.
allow_input = true

# This allows you to prevent the user from easily downloading the corpus from the Documents panel.
# The default value is true (to allow downloads), set this to false to hide the download and
# modify buttons in the Documents panel.
allow_download = true

# This allows you to prevent private IPs being used as corpus inputs.
# By default private IPs are allowed for VoyantServer, but
# they should probably be disallowed for a public server. 
allow_private_ip = true
